        <p>An interactive story of an organism's life.</p>

        <p>
            Play as Sundura from birth to death in a habitat rich of life. Upon birth you will be raised by
            your mother, migrating your way north through routes established by your ancestors. All the while
            embracing what it means to be alive as you learn to survive, play and collaborate
            with the life around you, and eventually give birth to new life of your own. But unlike the lives of your ancestors, your life will be effected by a new
            growing force of artificial organisms that are slowly extracting the life out of your habitat.

            <!--Play as Sundura from birth to death in a habitat that is slowly diminishing due to the extraction
            of vital resources by the ever advancing artificial organisms.-->

        <p>
            The game is in its early stages of production and is being developed by me,
            <a class="link-button" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/VakeyRujevic">Vakey Rujevic.</a>
            Due to it's large scope, the game will be broken up and released into the following 4 chapters.
            The following also represents the game's development progress.

        <div class="section-block chapters">
            <div ng-repeat="chapter in chapters" class="chapter-item">
